# CS543

The answers to the programming project (parts 1 and 2) are in the folders project_part1 and project_part2, respectively. The output of the programs is shown in the files hw1_part1.txt (in the first directory) and in hw1_part2.txt (in the second directory). Makefiles are included such that a simple make command will create the needed kernel modules in each directory.

The answers to the 6 additional homework questions are in class_questions.txt in the root directory. The source code supporting the simulation to answer one is in the project_part2_nokfree directory. A Makefile is included
