The run of the initial version of the program (256 entries) shows:

Page-fault rate in percent: 24.400000
TLB hit rate in percent: 5.500000

For the first version of the program there was never a need to move a page out of phyiscal memory, so we show no stats on page evacuation (soft flush, no write to backing store) rate

The run of the second version (128 entries) shows:

Page-fault rate in percent: 24.400000
TLB hit rate in percent: 5.500000
Page evacuation rate in percent: 11.599999

The TLB hit rate and page fault rate remain the same as these are unchanged. Because there is no writing to pages I called my new stat (which measures the percent of times we overwrite an entry in our now-smaller physical memory) the "page evacuation" rate.

The run of the third version (using addresses2.txt and only counting a flush for a page with the write bit set) show the statistics:

Page-fault rate in percent: 24.375626
TLB hit rate in percent: 5.594406
Page flush rate in percent: 4.495504

This shows that the TLB hit rate was slightly higher, suggestion a greater locality of access patterns in the addresses2 dataset vs addresses1
